# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates **face detection** in images using **Python** and **OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier**.

## Features
- Detects faces in a given image.
- Draws green rectangles around detected faces.
- Prints the number of faces found.
- Works with any image placed in the project folder.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Numpy (`numpy`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaushikt-04/Face_Detection.git```
Navigate into the project folder:
    cd Face_Detection
Install dependencies:
    pip install opencv-python numpy

A window will open showing detected faces with green rectangles.
